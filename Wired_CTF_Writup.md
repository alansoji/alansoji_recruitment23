##70ugh_n07_70UgH
As per the hint given connect the arduino uno to the pc
connect the wires to the ports 2,3,4,5 these are obtained from analysis of the code given for the task
So based on the code, connections were made between 1. (5 and high)   2.  (4 and high)  3.  (3 and high)   4. (2 and LOW).
Hence after the connections were made correctly, the flag was given in the serial monitor.

##Achan's Favorite
Upon understanding tht the attatchment is an audio file tht needs to be decoded i understood from previous experience tht it is a steganographic problem
Using audacity i converted the audio to a steganograph which gave the popular meme named "emotional Damage"
even though i failed when trying emotional damage as a flag i succeeded on getting the flag after inputing steven he the progenitor of the meme

##Ain't no sunshine!
the attatchment was a blueprint for the connections to be made 
when connected the board simply gave the flag on the serial monitor

##Crypto Layers
The code we were supposed to crack was clearly binary
so i first converted the binary to ascii
then as per the hint used the ceaser cipher on it and shifter to 5? ig this gave two different inputs
I used both the outputs and input them into the vignere cipher with the key provided and one of them yielded the answer
all conversions were done in Dcode.fr

##da_french_cipher
simple use od vignere cipher using the key provided(aeiou)
all conversions were done in Dcode.org

##Connected the ESP8266 to the system and logged into its wifi network
Then logged into the device server using the ip adress
The encrypted flag was hidden in the web page which was revealed on inspecting the page
The flag was decoded using online decrypter

##F1rmw4r3.b1n
Connected the arduino to the laptop
From hints searched on avrdude command sets 
went thru avrdude documentation
Executed the avrdude code with the device name and board name obtained from avrdude documentation
This gave a .hex file which was converted to .bin and then to strings
used grep to find the flag

##Find me!
Upon following the lead Jenisha harrisson on twitter i found the instagram handle of jenisha to be jenishappy
On inspection of the posts the account i made a wrong deduction tht she was in india as there was a pic of indian food peing served
on closer analysis i found a name in the pic of a switch tht seemed suspicious
upon searching the name i found it was an italian company and thus italy was the flag

##GATE_reversing
The attatchment was a pic of a logic diagram with various AND OR NAND NOR and XOR gates upo learning about these i reversed the diagram usinbg the output given and the inputs i discovered was the flag

##get wired 2
given to us on the first day of hardware at shreyas lab.

##get wired 1
the flag was provided on the discord server.

##grep it
The task instructed us to get the flag from the attatchment using the basic commands
From the title it is given tht the desired command is grep
I did some research on grep and understood tht it is used to extract certain words from a string list
I used the command strings <name of the attatchment>|grep wired
which gave me the flag

##L05T_With1n_R0bots
The hint of the task asked mne to connect to the esp device and log into its wifi network afterwards join its server(Using the ip adress)
Afterwards there was no clue as to where to go but from my previous experience i understood tht the title itself was a clue
This prompted me to look into ROBOTS 
A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site.
I obtained the text file from the inspect tab and inside it was the flag

##MICH43L5_P4R4DIS3
The given attatchment was the image of a screenshot from gta v which i instantly recognised as it was a game i was familiar with
upon a Quick Bing Visual Search i was able to determine its name 
The name was the flag in question

##micropython_flag
Connecting the ESP8266 to the lap using USB cable.
Arduino Ide must be Downloaded
The Baud rate must be set to 11500
This provides a python interface at the serial monitor
On communicating with the board and after multiple failures i gave the command flag() which gave the flag

##sh0d4n
The name itself suggest to use shodan the search engine
I learned about the queries in shodan
Afterwards upon searching country:"CA" followed by the contents of the truck
This provides three ip adresses out of which one is the flag
got the flag by trial and error

##simple web
The website generated asked for a userid and password
Upon inspecting the website and opening the script.js file i got the the userid-WebWarrior_Enigma and pass-B4dm1Nt0n_1S_be5t_g4me.
This gave me a base64 encrypted msg which on converting to ascii gave me the flag.

##u_4r7
Before attempting the task i learned about UART(which is a communication protocol)
Then i connected the rx and tx according to the hints
Then i connected d2 d3 and the groung to the logic analyzer 
Connect the arduino to usb port of the laptop and the logic analyzer usb to another port of the laptop
Download salea logic analyzer
Run the analyzer capture the output and open the logic analyser terminal to get the flag

##Web Sleuth!
As the hint suggested i looked up Esteban Lavos on Github His readme.md suggested that he also goes by the name escobar lavoss and to find him on X
on looking up his X id, i found few posts and inside one of the replies i got the flag.

##what's_up_DoH
The attatchment tto this challenge was pcap.gz 
Thus from previous experience i used wireshark with the DNS filter
The filtered data lead to https://idk567.my.canva.site/
Whose site name was the flag

##w!r3d_sh4rk
The attatchment to this file was pcapng.gz plus the title suggested wire shark so i installed wireshark
Wireshark is an open source packet analyzer
On applying dns as the filter got the flag
